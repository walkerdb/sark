            <div>
                <p>Founded by the US government in 1942 to counter Nazi radio propaganda abroad, over the course of the
                    war the Voice of America program quickly grew to provide shortwave broadcasts in 40 languages.
                    Though created to transmit news, the stations also played over 1,000 specialized programs, including
                    music and commentary.</p>

                <p>Voice of America transferred first to the State Department in 1945, and then to the U.S. Information
                    Agency in 1953. This move ushered in the radio service’s Cold War era, to which the bulk of the
                    Sarkisian recordings belong. With a renewed commitment to counteracting propaganda abroad, the VOA
                    continued to broadcast news from the United States and around the world, targeting nations behind
                    the Iron Curtain. Often the VOA’s most popular and influential programs, however, were not news but
                    music shows, particularly those featuring American jazz musicians. Historians credit programs such
                    as “Music USA”--a two-hour daily broadcast of jazz and pop music--with popularizing jazz outside the
                    U.S., particularly in Soviet nations.</p>

                <p>As with its European counterparts, for much of its early existence the Voice of America tactically
                    used American culture to advance U.S. strategic interests on the continent. Leo Sarkisian's "Music
                    Time in Africa" program, however, broke that mold. Instead of pushing American music onto his
                    African listeners, Leo instead played traditional and contemporary music of Africa itself, often in
                    the form of live field recordings captured on one of his many trips through the continent, making a
                    sincere effort to spread knowledge of traditions and the broad musical and cultural diversity to be
                    found in each African nation.</p>

                <p>Now administered by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the Voice of America continues to broadcast
                    to countries around the world. VOA has reduced its number of stations in the past decade,
                    eliminating many of its services to Asia and Europe due to budget cuts and shifting diplomatic
                    priorities. Among the 41 foreign languages still on the air are 13 spoken in African countries, as
                    well as 4 of its English language stations.</p>

            <h1 id="MTiA">Leo Sarkisian & Music Time in Africa</h1>

            <div>
                <p>Leo Sarkisian is a remarkable man: an Armenian-American artist and music lover from Lawrence,
                    Massachusetts who became a globetrotting musicologist, world-class recordist, and musical ambassador
                    to millions.</p>

                <p>Leo began his professional life in the visual arts. He studied at the Vesper George School of Art,
                    drew battlefield maps for the U.S. Army during the Second World War, and afterwards worked as a
                    freelance illustrator in New York City. But he spent his free time in studying the folk and ethnic
                    music he loved, and wrote a paper on the subject that brought him to the attention of Irving Fogel,
                    head of Tempo Records. Fogel hired Sarkisian, provided him with extensive technical training, and
                    sent him to record world music in Central Asia and then Africa in the 1950s. His excellent work with
                    Tempo convinced Edward Murrow, head of the United States Information Agency, that Sarkisian was the
                    man for the Voice of America's new Africa Division.</p>

                <p>It was the early 1960s, and Edward Murrow saw opportunities for Voice of America to expand into
                    Africa. He recognized that if VOA was to broadcast in Africa, it would be logical and necessary to
                    play African music. In 1963, Murrow traveled to Guinea to personally recruit Leo Sarkisian. After a
                    short return to Washington D.C. to complete Foreign Service Officer training and gather equipment,
                    Sarkisian headed to Liberia to begin recording music.</p>

                <p>Beginning in 1963, Leo Sarkisian traveled and recorded in 53 African countries, covering nearly all
                    of Africa outside of the Sahara and capturing an enormous variety of music and musicians—from
                    international stars of the big cities to village musicians who had never before been recorded. These
                    recordings have formed the base of Voice of America's radio show Music Time in Africa since
                    1965.</p>

                <p>Once Sarkisian had built up the respectable beginnings of a music library, "Music Time in Africa"
                    began broadcasting in 1965. Sarkisian wrote scripts for the show from the beginning, shipping them
                    back to the US along with "insert" tapes - containing each individual track of music meant to be
                    played for that program. In the 1970s he took on cohosting duties alongside Rita Rochelle Hunt.
                    Throughout that decade and the next the show’s popularity boomed, with the two hosts becoming
                    household names across the African continent. Sarkisian continued to travel through Africa,
                    recording music and meeting fans.</p>

                <h1 id="Tapes">Behind the Tapes</h1>

                <p>Throughout his recording career, Sarkisian followed the same basic method. Before traveling to any
                    country he researched in depth about its culture, musical styles and prominent personages. Upon
                    arrival, he and his wife Mary generally set up housekeeping and a home office in the largest city.
                    Traveling as employees of the United States government, Leo and Mary moved in diplomatic and
                    government circles, and the connections made there gave them the freedom and support to head out of
                    the city and circle the rural regions, capturing music that in many cases had never been been
                    recorded before. Their own warm, outgoing spirits meant they gathered friends wherever they
                    went.</p>

                <p>Leo traveled the rural areas by jeep or van when possible, by foot or donkey when not. He was usually
                    accompanied by a local guide or dignitary to smooth his way and make introductions, and Mary was
                    very often along as well to record the trip, set up microphones, and help explain the proceedings to
                    musicians. Leo made his recordings in every setting from concert halls to forest clearings, but
                    always got the best sound possible from his environment. He might have drummers sit next to the
                    wall, or set up a dozen microphones for a large choral group, and, once in Ghana, a canopy of mango
                    trees acted as a perfect acoustical ceiling. Due to his extensive work in rural areas, he was one of
                    the first to try new portable recording devices as they were developed, and he always made it a
                    point to play the recording back to the musicians afterward!</p>

                <p>Now the entirety of the remaining original tapes from Mr. Sarkisian's travels and broadcasts are held
                    by the University of Michigan. Once funding has been secured, we intend to embark on a large-scale
                    digitization and access project, making this material available to anyone with an internet
                    connection.</p>
